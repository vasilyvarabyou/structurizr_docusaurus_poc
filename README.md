# Website

This website is built using [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/), a modern static website generator.

### Preparation

```
$ make depend
```

### Local Development

```
$ make run-local
```

### Build

```
$ make build
```

This command generates static content into the `website/build` directory and can be served using any static contents hosting service.

### Deployment

The project uses [GitHub Pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/about-github-pages) to host [documentation generated based on the sources](https://vasilyvarabyou.github.io/structurizr_docusaurus_poc/)
